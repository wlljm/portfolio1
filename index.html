    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello there, I'm a coding bootcamp student who is passionate about learning and growing in the tech industry. I may still be a beginner, 
       but I am determined to become a skilled developer. I love challenges and problem-solving, 
       and I'm always eager to take on new coding projects. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm ready to put in the hard work to achieve my goals.</p>
